Field: C_PenMinutes
Purpose: Giving penalty minutes if data not available in Even Minutes or Event Severity; read penalty info from desription and assign penalty minutes based on 2018-2019 NHL rule book.
Note: when rules allow for referee discretion to assing 2, 5 or 10 minutes, I assumed 2 minutes

    IF [Event Minutes] <> "NA" THEN [Event Minutes]
    ELSEIF [Event Severity] <> "NA" THEN [Event Severity]
    ELSEIF CONTAINS([Event Description],"Too many men") = TRUE THEN "2" //IF description is too many men, then 2

    ELSEIF [Event Secondary (group)] = "Minor*" THEN "2"
    ELSEIF [Event Secondary (group)] = "Major" THEN "5"
